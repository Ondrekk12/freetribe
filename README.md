# Freetribe

Freetribe is a free, open-source firmware for Electribe 2, 
built from the ground up using original code and open-source projects. 
Freetribe aims to provide a user-friendly API for connecting control input to audio processing.

A preview of the code is currently available to [sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/bangcorrupt), 
I hope to push to this public repo by the end of the month.

For now, the [documentation](https://bangcorrupt.github.io/freetribe-docs/) is available and growing.
